                <p>On this day in history we're sure that at some point, a knight was probably riding his horse somewhere probably very far from here. Chances are he was holding a sword, because they didn't call it the dark ages for nothing. I mean let's be real, it was probably cloudy too, because England.</p>
                <p>At first I thought it was a unicorn. Just look at that horse's ear. You see it, right? I wonder if he's comfortable with that parachute of a shirt on. Certainly not comfortable with a fully-armored knight chilling on his back. Talk about needing a chiropractor.</p>
                <p>That's all I got. Lorem Ipsum would have probably been easier. I mean, Latin is historical, right?</p>
